# Online lowest-price-finder for products

Welcome to a Python based web-scraping application that parses and scrapes common online sites to find the lowest price of purchasable products!

I spent many hours tinkering with the concept of web-scraping before figuring out how to extract code from HTML and processing it in python.

This web application that allows a user to search for the lowest price of electronics online was made using Python, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Flask, JSON.
